            <td>DAY HAD DAWNED COLD AND GRAY WHEN the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail. He climbed the high earth-bank where a
                <br>little -traveled trail led east through the pine forest. It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe at the top. He excused the act to himself by
                <br>looking at his watch. It was nine o clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although there was not a cloud in the skv. It was a
                <br>clear day. However, there seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. That was because the sun was absent from the skv
                <br>This fact did not worry the man. He was not alarmed by the lack or sun. It nad been days since ne had seen the sun.
                <br><br>The man looked along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet
                <br>of snow. It was all pure white. North and south, as far as his eye could see it was unbroken white. The one thing that relieved the whiteness was
                <br>a thin dark line that curved from the pine-covered island to the south. It curved into the north, where it disappeared behind another pine-covered
                <br>island. This dark line was the trail- the main trail. It led south 500 miles to the Chilcoot Pass, and salt water. It led north 75 miles to Dawson, and
                <br>still farther on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato and finally to St. Michael, on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.
                <br><br><mark>But all this the distant trail. no sun in the sky, the great cold, and the strangeness of it all- had no effect on the man. It was not because he was
                <br>long familiar with it. He was a newcomer in the land, and this was his first winter.</mark>
